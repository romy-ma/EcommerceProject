# E-Commerce Project Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the e-commerce project built with Express.js, JWT authentication, and MongoDB.

## Project Overview

The e-commerce project aims to create a web application where users can browse products, add them to the cart, make purchases, and manage their accounts. The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Express.js**: A Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs.
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Token authentication for securing routes and endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store product data, user information, and order details.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication

- Users can sign up with a username, email, and password.
- Users can log in using their email and password.
- JWT tokens are used for user authentication and authorization.

### 2. Product Management

- Admin users can add, edit, and delete products.
- Products are displayed with details such as name, description, price, and image.

### 3. Shopping Cart

- Users can add products to their shopping cart.
- Users can view their cart, update quantities, and remove items.
- Cart information is stored in the user's session or database.

### 4. Checkout Process

- Users can proceed to checkout and enter their shipping details.
- Orders are created and stored in the database.
- Users receive confirmation emails with order details after successful checkout.

### 5. User Account Management

- Users can view their profile, update their information, and change their password.
- Users can view their order history and track the status of their orders.

## Project Structure

The project follows a typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

- **Models**: Define the data structure and interact with the MongoDB database.
- **Views**: Render HTML templates and handle user interface elements.
- **Controllers**: Handle user requests, process data, and interact with models.
- **Routes**: Define the endpoints and route requests to the appropriate controllers.

## Installation and Setup

To run the e-commerce project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection string in the project.
4. Set environment variables for JWT secret key, database URI, and other configuration options.
5. Run the project using `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## Future Improvements

Some potential improvements for the e-commerce project include:

- Implementing pagination for product listings to improve performance.
- Adding user reviews and ratings for products.
- Integrating third-party payment gateways for secure online transactions.
- Enhancing the admin dashboard with analytics and reporting features.

## Conclusion

The e-commerce project provides a foundation for building a fully functional online shopping platform. By leveraging Express.js, JWT authentication, and MongoDB, the project offers essential features for users to browse, purchase, and manage products with ease. With further enhancements and optimizations, the project can scale to meet the needs of a growing e-commerce business.
